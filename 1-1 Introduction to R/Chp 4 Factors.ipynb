For example, human hair color can be categorized as black, brown, blond, red, grey, or white—and perhaps a few more options for people who color their hair. In R, categorical data is stored in factors. Factors are very important in data analysis, so start learning how to create, subset, and compare them now."

The difference between a categorical variable and a continuous variable is that a categorical variable can belong to a limited number of categories. A continuous variable, on the other hand, can correspond to an infinite number of values.\n\nIt is important that R knows whether it is dealing with a continuous or a categorical variable, as the statistical models you will develop in the future treat both types differently. (You will see later why this is the case.)\n\nA good example of a categorical variable is `sex`. In many circumstances you can limit the sex categories to `\"Male\"` or `\"Female\"`. (Sometimes you may need different categories. For example, you may need to consider chromosomal variation, hermaphroditic animals, or different cultural norms, but you will always have a finite number of categories.)"

(3)\nThere are two types of categorical variables: a **nominal categorical variable** and an **ordinal categorical variable**.\n\nA nominal variable is a **categorical variable** without an implied order. This means that it is impossible to say that 'one is worth more than the other'. For example, think of the categorical variable `animals_vector` with the categories `\"Elephant\"`, `\"Giraffe\"`, `\"Donkey\"` and `\"Horse\"`. Here, it is impossible to say that one stands above or below the other. (Note that some of you might disagree ;-) ).\n\nIn contrast, **ordinal variables** do have a natural ordering. Consider for example the categorical variable `temperature_vector` with the categories: `\"Low\"`, `\"Medium\"` and `\"High\"`. Here it is obvious that `\"Medium\"` stands above `\"Low\"`, and `\"High\"` stands above `\"Medium\"`."

R allows you to do this with the function `levels()`:\n\n> `levels(factor_vector) <- c(\"name1\", \"name2\",...)`\n\nA good illustration is the raw data that is provided to you by a survey. A common question for every questionnaire is the sex of the respondent. Here, for simplicity, just two categories were recorded, `\"M\"` and `\"F\"`. (You usually need more categories for survey data; either way, you use a factor to store the categorical data.)\n\n> `survey_vector <- c(\"M\", \"F\", \"F\", \"M\", \"M\")`\n\nRecording the sex with the abbreviations `\"M\"` and `\"F\"` can be convenient if you are collecting data with pen and paper, but it can introduce confusion when analyzing the data. At that point, you will often want to change the factor levels to `\"Male\"` and `\"Female\"` instead of `\"M\"` and `\"F\"` for clarity.\n\nWatch out: **the order with which you assign the levels is important**. If you type `levels(factor_survey_vector)`, you'll see that it outputs `[1] \"F\" \"M\"`. If you don't specify the levels of the factor when creating the vector, R will automatically assign them alphabetically. To correctly map `\"F\"` to `\"Female\"` and `\"M\"` to `\"Male\"`, the levels should be set to `c(\"Female\", \"Male\")`, in this order."
